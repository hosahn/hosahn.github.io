Why did I started bloging?</h3>\n<p>As I progressed in my career in the field of Computer Science, I realized that our brains have a limit when it comes to retaining new information. The more I learned and explored emerging technologies, the more I found myself forgetting even fundamental concepts. Now that Iâ€™m beginning my studies at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), I feel that this is the perfect time to start documenting my journey.</p>\n<p>Thatâ€™s why I created this blogâ€”especially in TypeScript (because, letâ€™s be honest, TS is the language now! ðŸ˜†). This space serves as my personal knowledge base while also helping me connect with like-minded experts in the field.</p>\n<h3>2. Contents of my Blog</h3>\n<p>This blog chronicles my journey through the world of cybersecurity as I navigate my studies at TUM. Youâ€™ll find a mix of posts in both Korean and English, reflecting my experiences as a Korean student on the path to becoming an ethical hacker.</p>\n<p>My goal is to document my learning process, share insights, and discuss the challenges I encounter while working toward certifications like the Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP). Whether youâ€™re interested in ethical hacking, cybersecurity techniques, or academic life at TUM, I hope to provide valuable content that bridges both languages and cultures.</p>\n<p>Expect to see:\r\nâœ… Tutorials and tips on cybersecurity\r\nâœ… Ethical hacking insights\r\nâœ… My experiences and study techniques\r\nâœ… Reflections on university life at TUM</p>\n<p>Join me as I dive into the ever-evolving world of cybersecurity, share my knowledge, and contribute to the global conversation on digital security. Whether youâ€™re a fellow student, a cybersecurity enthusiast, or simply curious about the field, I hope you find my posts both informative and engaging.</p>\n<h3>3.
