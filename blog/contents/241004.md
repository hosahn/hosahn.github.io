- access to port 80

Denied. Nothing special

## 2. Enumeration & Foothold

- 8082
![image](../contentImages/hub/2.png)

As I entered the website, I had to set an admin account by myself. Or, you can also add users with specific roles (have to be admin or TunFullAcc)

Maybe we'll need this afterwards

Then, I found Authenticated RCE with version 8.4


> https://github.com/SanjinDedic/FuguHub-8.4-Authenticated-RCE-CVE-2024-27697


Which complies our version:

This site is really buggy, but actually it revealed version number (8.4) on about page.

So, I modified the script with my account which I created before, and started a listener.

Done.

Fairly easy (or even VERY easy) machine..
