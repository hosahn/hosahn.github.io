Okay, redis is a databank so far as I know

## 2. Initial Foothold

As I searched for redis in searchsploit
```

Our redis version is 4.0.14, we have Unauthenticated RCE Metasploit module.

But I'll use python script from:

https://github.com/n0b0dyCN/redis-rogue-server

Done.
## 3. PrivEsc

So after scanning:
```

$ sudo -l
sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for prudence on blackgate:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User prudence may run the following commands on blackgate:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/redis-status
$ /usr/local/bin/redis-status
/usr/local/bin/redis-status
[*] Redis Uptime
Authorization Key:

Wrong Authorization Key!
Incident has been reported!

```
Hmm, okay. A binary which we don't know the code itself -> analyse with strings. Snippet:

```

[]A\A]A^A_
[*] Redis Uptime
Authorization Key:
ClimbingParrotKickingDonkey321

```

So this is our authorization key.

I played around for a while, and :


```

                   SUMMARY OF LESS COMMANDS

      Commands marked with * may be preceded by a number, N.
      Notes in parentheses indicate the behavior if N is given.
      A key preceded by a caret indicates the Ctrl key; thus ^K is ctrl-K.

  h  H                 Display this help.
  q  :q  Q  :Q  ZZ     Exit.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                           MOVING

  e  ^E  j  ^N  CR  *  Forward  one line   (or N lines).
  y  ^Y  k  ^K  ^P  *  Backward one line   (or N lines).
  f  ^F  ^V  SPACE  *  Forward  one window (or N lines).
  b  ^B  ESC-v      *  Backward one window (or N lines).
  z                 *  Forward  one window (and set window to N).
  w                 *  Backward one window (and set window to N).
  ESC-SPACE         *  Forward  one window, but don't stop at end-of-file.
  d  ^D             *  Forward  one half-window (and set half-window to N).
  u  ^U             *  Backward one half-window (and set half-window to N).
  ESC-)  RightArrow *  Right one half screen width (or N positions).

```

Less? Maybe we can find a way to escalate our privilege by utilizing this command.

So it seems to be that I have right to execute "less" commands in this "session."

```
