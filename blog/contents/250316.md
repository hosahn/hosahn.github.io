## 1. Initial Foothold

Starting nmap scan, we found:
```

```

There are some suspicious ports. Let's dig deeper.

```

```

So, it's hadoop application. (9091 is datanode for 9090 I guess)
I've seen it before but can't quite remember what it was.

> **Apache Hadoop** is a collection of open-source software utilities for reliable, scalable, [distributed computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing "Distributed computing"). It provides a [software framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework "Software framework") for [distributed storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustered_file_system "Clustered file system")...

Let's try visiting it.

- port 9090

Okay, we have openfire with version number 4.7.3

I found this site:

Openfire Console Authentication Bypass Vulnerability (CVE-2023-3215)
Use at your own risk!

```

I tried to log in with credential.

Succeed. This version also includes the file(plugin) upload vulnerability. Let's upload plugin (following the steps from the link above) and proceed.
![image](../contentImages/fired/3.png)

This machine is slow as hell. I really wanted to use metasploit module, but since this vulnerability was quite interesting, I just waited and waited...
![image](../contentImages/fired/4.png)

Password should be 123 if you followed steps above.
![image](../contentImages/fired/5.png)

Done. Let's get revshell and continue with privilege escalation.

I tried a lot for revshell, then busybox(this is the first time I've ever used that) gave me a hit.

```
┌──(hlee㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ nc -lvnp 80  
listening on [any] 80 ...
connect to [192.168.45.233] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.190.96] 43900
whoami
openfire
```

## 2. Privilege Escalation

I had no fun since this was **pure credential hunting**. I couldn't find any other vector so I just started brute forcing all the scripts and files which might have passwords in it.

Then, this gave me a hit:

```
cat /var/lib/openfire/embedded-db/openfire.script
```

There was root credential in this file, which might have been reused for ssh:
```
INSERT INTO OFPROPERTY VALUES('mail.smtp.password','OpenFireAtEveryone',0,NULL)                                     
INSERT INTO OFPROPERTY VALUES('mail.smtp.port','25',0,NULL)                                                         
INSERT INTO OFPROPERTY VALUES('mail.smtp.ssl','false',0,NULL)                                                       
INSERT INTO OFPROPERTY VALUES('mail.smtp.username','root',0,NULL)   
```

And yes, it succeed.

```
root@openfire:~# whoami
root
```

Actually, after looking at other's writeup, the path to this credential file should have been popped with env command. But in my case (another day of offsec machine I guess), env was empty.

I really hope that this kind of privesc vector does not show up in the real exam.
