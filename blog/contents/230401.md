## 1. What is SMTP?

- Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
- often port 25 or 587
- used by Mail Server, just like IMAP&POP3
- STMP sends, IMAP&POP3 retrieve.

## 2. Process with MUA, MSA, MDA

> The MUA (Mail User Agent) is the email client used by the end-user to compose and send email messages. When the user clicks the "Send" button, the MUA sends the message to the MSA (Mail Submission Agent), which is responsible for accepting messages from the MUA and forwarding them to the appropriate mail server.
> 
> 
> The MSA uses SMTP to communicate with the mail server, which is responsible for receiving and storing incoming messages. The SMTP protocol is used to transfer the message from the MSA to the mail server.
> 
> Once the message has been received by the mail server, it is then forwarded to the appropriate MDA (Mail Delivery Agent), which is responsible for delivering the message to the recipient's mailbox.
>
