### 0. What do I need to read this Post?

- You should have a basic knowledge about binary/BCD Code 
- You should know what Register-CPU / Byte / Bit are
- You should know basic data formats like Integer/Char/etc...


### 1. What is ISA?

> An Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) is part of the abstract model of a computer that defines how the CPU is controlled by the software. The ISA acts as an interface between the hardware and the software, specifying both what the processor is capable of doing as well as how it gets done.

Everything combined : ISA is a simplified drawing of CPU for programmers; it instructs how a programmer should access to CPU and give an order.

So, what are the components of an ISA? :


1. **Instruction Set**
2. **Register Set**
3. **Memory Organization**


We are going to summary each components step by step.


### 2. Memory Model :

Memory Model defines how
