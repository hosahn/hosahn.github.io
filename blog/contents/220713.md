### 1. Why did I started bloging?

Since I started my career in CS field, I noticed that our brain has it's own limit to save new informations.
More and more I learn and get in touch with the newest technologies, I felt that I'm forgetting some basic or even important things.
Furthermore, I am now entering University (TU Munich) so I think now is the best timing.

Thus, I always tried to make my own blog, (especially in TypeScript because you know, TS is now THE language.. :D )
to save my knowledge and make some good connections with other experts. :)


### 2. Contents of my Blog

I want to share my journey through the world of cybersecurity while pursuing my studies at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). Here, you'll find a mix of posts in both Korean and English, reflecting my experiences as a Korean student navigating the path to becoming an ethical hacker.

This blog serves as a platform to document my learning process, insights, and challenges as I work towards certifications like OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional). Whether you're interested in ethical hacking, cybersecurity techniques, or academic life at TUM, you'll find valuable content that bridges both languages and cultures.

Join me as I explore the ever-evolving field of cybersecurity, share tips, tutorials, and personal experiences, and contribute to the global conversation on security in the digital age. Whether you're a fellow student, a cybersecurity enthusiast, or just curious about the field, I hope you'll find my posts both informative and engaging.

### 3. Welcome!

I am still working on this blog, so there will be continueously updates!
You can visit my SNS or Github, you can find links for them pretty easily.

If you want to contact me, please use the "Contact" menu.

Sincerely, Hosan Lee.
